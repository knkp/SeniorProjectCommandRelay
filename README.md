# SeniorProjectCommandRelay
This runs on a raspberry pi and redirects data between the graphical user interface, the peripheral controller, and the management utility, it also can record or retrieve patron metadata locally

The script in this repo tells linux to run the command relay (or the RPSS_Pi_Manager) at startup
